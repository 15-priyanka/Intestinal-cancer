<h3 class="third"> SYMPTOMS:</h3>
<p>Signs and symptoms of colon cancer include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A persistent change in your bowel habits, including diarrhea or constipation or a change in the consistency of your stool</li><li>
Rectal bleeding or blood in your stool</li><li>
Persistent abdominal discomfort, such as cramps, gas or pain</li><li>
A feeling that your bowel doesn't empty completely</li><li>
Weakness or fatigue</li><li>
Unexplained weight loss</li></ul>

<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Doctors aren't certain what causes most colon cancers.</li><li>

In general, colon cancer begins when healthy cells in the colon develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains a set of instructions that tell a cell what to do.</li><li>

Healthy cells grow and divide in an orderly way to keep your body functioning normally. But when a cell's DNA is damaged and becomes cancerous, cells continue to divide â€” even when new cells aren't needed. As the cells accumulate, they form a tumor.</li><li>

With time, the cancer cells can grow to invade and destroy normal tissue nearby. And cancerous cells can travel to other parts of the body to form deposits there (metastasis).</li>
</ul>
